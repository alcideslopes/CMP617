4267;there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .;0
4268;the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .;0
4269;a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .;0
4270;the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .;0
4271;a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .;0
4272;in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .;0
4273;without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers .;0

4286;there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .;0
4287;madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .;0
4288;it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .;0
4289;it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .;0
4290;despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .;0

4297;guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .;0
4298;as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .;0
4299;this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .;0
4300;there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .;0
4301;this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .;0
4302;all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .;0
4303;it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .;0
4304;bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon .;0
4305;off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all .;0
4306;oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring .;0

4318;most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .;0
4319;a generic international version of a typical american horror film .;0
4320;it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt .;0
4321;it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .;0
4322;a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .;0
4323;it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .;0
4324;the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .;0
4325;we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .;0
4326;neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .;0
4327;though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .;0
4328;spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .;0
4329;the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .;0

4331;if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .;0
4332;there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .;0

4339;it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .;0

4343;a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect .;0

4354;new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .;0
4355;seems like someone going through the motions .;0
4356;paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat .;0
4357;[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .;0
4358;interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen;0

4360;a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie .;0
4361;bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .;0
4362;in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .;0
4363;there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0
4364;not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .;0
4365;you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] .;0
4366;possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .;0
4367;i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .;0
4368;a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .;0
4369;pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .;0
4370;. . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .;0
4371;there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .;0
4372;"what goes on for the 110 minutes of "" panic room "" is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .";0
4373;the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .;0
4374;walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .;0
4375;may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .;0
4376;the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes;0
4377;too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .;0
4378;. . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .;0
4379;the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .;0
4380;despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .;0
4381;"the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .";0
4382;the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .;0

4406;sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .;0
4407;for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . ';0
4408;the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .;0
4409;moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .;0
4410;the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .;0
4411;aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .;0
4412;silly , loud and goofy .;0
4413;stay away . far away .;0
4414;patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .;0
4415;what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .;0
4416;an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse .;0
4417;the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .;0
4418;a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .;0
4419;the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned .;0
4420;deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .;0
4421;chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .;0
4422;it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .;0
4423;sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .;0
4424;i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .;0
4425;large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better .;0

4459;truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before .;0
4460;at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .;0
4461;shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies .;0

4466;the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .;0

4508;every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them .;0
4509;[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .;0
4510;the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 .;0
4511;a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .;0
4512;characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .;0
4513;any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .;0
4514;uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .;0
4515;"such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us "" the skulls "" and last year's "" rollerball . "" enough said , except : film overboard !";0
4516;it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call .;0
4517;the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .;0
4518;a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls .;0
4519;national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion;0
4520;has its charming quirks and its dull spots .;0
4521;what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .;0
4522;the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .;0
4523;what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?;0
4524;the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates .;0

4529;it's splash without the jokes .;0
4530;detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .;0
4531;"the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear .";0
4532;there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .;0
4533;if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .;0
4534;the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .;0
4535;the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .;0
4536;charming , if overly complicated . . .;0
4537;it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise .;0
4538;had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .;0
4539;splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings .;0
4540;the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion .;0
4541;the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .;0
4542;the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .;0
4543;a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .;0
4544;it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .;0
4545;an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow .;0
4546;rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .;0

4548;boy oh boy , it's a howler .;0
4549;unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .;0
4550;with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .;0
4551;you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .;0
4552;. . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .;0
4553;a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .;0
4554;not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .;0
4555;one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .;0
4556;enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .;0
4557;because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling .;0
4558;falls short in explaining the music and its roots .;0
4559;might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .;0
4560;with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .;0
4561;i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .;0
4562;a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .;0
4563;the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .;0
4564;feels like a cold old man going through the motions .;0
4565;[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .;0
4566;no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .;0
4567;an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .;0
4568;van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .;0
4569;when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ?;0
4570;why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one .;0
4571;mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .;0
4572;a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .;0
4573;although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .;0
4574;drowning's too good for this sucker .;0
4575;a great idea becomes a not-great movie .;0
4576;in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .;0
4577;"the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .";0
4578;its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer .;0
4579;without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .;0
4580;not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too .;0
4581;the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking .;0
4582;a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .;0
4583;the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .;0
4584;chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .;0
4585;woefully pretentious .;0
4586;the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .;0
4587;the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .;0
4588;completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .;0
4589;the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film .;0
4590;more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .;0
4591;if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .;0
4592;no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .;0
4593;what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height .;0
4594;why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ?;0
4595;the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .;0
4596;it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen .;0
4597;why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?;0
4598;in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .;0
4599;instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture;0
4600;do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .;0
4601;"good for a few unintentional laughs , "" extreme ops "" was obviously made for the "" xxx "" crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .";0
4602;soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .;0
4603;some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one .;0
4604;a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .;0
4605;they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .;0
4606;a bravura exercise in emptiness .;0
4607;the film's essentially over by the meet-cute .;0
4608;a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .;0
4609;a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .;0
4610;human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .;0
4611;there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .;0
4612;there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .;0
4613;you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .;0
4614;the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .;0
4615;whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .;0
4616;the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .;0
4617;director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?;0
4618;this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .;0
4619;a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .;0
4620;benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice .;0
4621;while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .;0
4622;an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .;0
4623;that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .;0
4624;kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .;0
4625;if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .;0
4626;vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much .;0
4627;although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .;0
4628;for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .;0
4629;little more than a well-mounted history lesson .;0
4630;i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .;0
4631;an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .;0
4632;ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls .;0
4633;jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .;0
4634;"a gushy episode of "" m * a * s * h "" only this time from an asian perspective .";0
4635;a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .;0
4636;mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .;0
4637;[a] crushing disappointment .;0
4638;bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film;0
4639;this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .;0
4640;an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .;0
4641;although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .;0
4642;it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's .;0
4643;ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .;0
4644;i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . ';0
4645;"each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .";0
4646;the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .;0
4647;a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .;0
4648;the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . ';0
4649;an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .;0
4650;it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .;0
4651;a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .;0
4652;there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .;0
4653;"an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .";0
4654;'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .;0
4655;a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work .;0
4656;a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) .;0
4657;a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series .;0
4658;i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .;0
4659;a noble failure .;0
4660;when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .;0
4661;"it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .";0
4662;the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .;0
4663;adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .;0
4664;the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .;0
4665;a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .;0
4666;full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .;0
4667;shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .;0
4668;the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .;0
4669;rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .;0
4670;this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .;0
4671;this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .;0
4672;in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .;0
4673;"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 "" black and white portable tv .";0
4674;too much of the humor falls flat .;0
4675;one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .;0
4676;is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?;0
4677;all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .;0
4678;the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .;0
4679;while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house .;0
4680;what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .;0
4681;it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .;0
4682;responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade .;0
4683;scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .;0
4684;no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .;0
4685;manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .;0
4686;an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .;0
4687;k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .;0
4688;though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .;0
4689;there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .;0
4690;what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .;0
4691;everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .;0
4692;another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .;0
4693;not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .;0
4694;labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .;0
4695;the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .;0
4696;anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss .;0
4697;to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .;0
4698;it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .;0
4699;mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness;0
4700;a film with a great premise but only a great premise .;0
4701;it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .;0
4702;even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .;0
4703;less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .;0
4704;things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .;0
4705;has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .;0
4706;payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .;0
4707;the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .;0
4708;one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .;0
4709;in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .;0
4710;the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .;0
4711;you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .;0
4712;""" my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! "" yes , you are , ben kingsley .";0
4713;pumpkin wants to have it both ways .;0
4714;its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary .;0
4715;the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .;0
4716;the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .;0
4717;one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .;0
4718;choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . ';0
4719;cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .;0
4720;"it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . "" interview "" loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .";0
4721;this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .;0
4722;an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .;0
4723;the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .;0
4724;it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .;0
4725;can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center .;0
4726;the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .;0
4727;anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . ';0
4728;shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .;0
4729;by-the-numbers yarn .;0
4730;without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .;0
4731;nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try .;0
4732;the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .;0
4733;so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .;0
4734;'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .;0
4735;you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .;0
4736;a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .;0
4737;a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .;0
4738;the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .;0
4739;amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .;0
4740;odd and weird .;0
4741;follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .;0
4742;this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .;0

4745;despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .;0
4746;too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .;0
4747;don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .;0
4748;blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .;0
4749;hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .;0
4750;this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states .;0
4751;the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .;0

4757;stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .;0
4758;even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .;0
4759;when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it .;0
4760;in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .;0
4761;analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .;0
4762;there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .;0
4763;disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .;0
4764;. . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .;0
4765;the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .;0
4766;the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .;0
4767;a picture as erratic as its central character .;0
4768;kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .;0
4769;a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .;0
4770;loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .;0
4771;all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .;0
4772;it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love .;0
4773;equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .;0
4774;queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .;0
4775;enduring love but exhausting cinema .;0
4776;it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .;0
4777;leaks treacle from every pore .;0
4778;if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .;0
4779;every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie !;0
4780;most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .;0
4781;technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .;0
4782;the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .;0
4783;this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .;0
4784;deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .;0
4785;"her fans walked out muttering words like "" horrible "" and "" terrible , "" but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero .";0
4786;we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .;0
4787;it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .;0
4788;so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .;0
4789;high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .;0
4790;there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .;0
4791;the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .;0
4792;first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .;0
4793;credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves;0
4794;has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd .;0
4795;the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .;0
4796;the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .;0
4797;been there done that .;0
4798;what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons .;0
4799;melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back .;0
4800;director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .;0
4801;animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .;0
4802;gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh .;0
4803;both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told .;0
4804;though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best .;0
4805;the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .;0
4806;the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .;0
4807;after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .;0
4808;calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .;0
4809;if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ?;0
4810;it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .;0
4811;it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .;0
4812;being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .;0
4813;it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .;0
4814;it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;0
4815;despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off;0
4816;offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .;0
4817;pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick .;0
4818;the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .;0

4820;"don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .";0
4821;this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .;0
4822;i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .;0
4823;there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .;0
4824;the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .;0
4825;however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .;0
4826;an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .;0
4827;instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .;0
4828;a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .;0
4829;kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .;0
4830;at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it;0
4831;the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .;0
4832;a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .;0
4833;dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit;0
4834;the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .;0
4835;the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .;0
4836;schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . .;0
4837;something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .;0
4838;hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry .;0
4839;green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .;0
4840;it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .;0
4841;rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .;0
4842;clever but not especially compelling .;0
4843;it bites hard .;0
4844;feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .;0
4845;. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .;0
4846;if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .;0
4847;despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .;0
4848;i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't .;0
4849;its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .;0
4850;a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .;0
4851;the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .;0
4852;there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .;0
4853;it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .;0
4854;well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .;0
4855;this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless .;0
4856;all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .;0
4857;the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .;0
4858;despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .;0
4859;a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price .;0
4860;i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .;0

4863;one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .;0
4864;could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .;0
4865;neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .;0
4866;it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .;0
4867;starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .;0
4868;bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad .;0
4869;imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .;0
4870;the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .;0
4871;it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .;0
4872;while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .;0
4873;the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ?;0
4874;makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .;0
4875;an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .;0
4876;the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it .;0
4877;our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . ';0
4878;nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .;0
4879;"every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .";0
4880;too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .;0
4881;taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .;0
4882;a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .;0
4883;self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable .;0
4884;lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .;0
4885;a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .;0
4886;a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .;0
4887;life is a crock -- or something like it .;0
4888;what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .;0
4889;oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .;0
4890;nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done .;0
4891;a moving picture that does not move .;0
4892;an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .;0
4893;plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .;0
4894;has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .;0
4895;it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .;0
4896;empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either .;0
4897;[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .;0
4898;watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .;0
4899;it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .;0
4900;one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .;0
4901;with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .;0
4902;dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .;0
4903;the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .;0

4907;the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .;0
4908;an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .;0
4909;well-meaning but inert .;0
4910;while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer;0
4911;. . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .;0
4912;there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .;0
4913;in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .;0
4914;borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .;0
4915;hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .;0

4920;there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .;0

4927;avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book .;0
4928;"vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .";0
4929;this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .;0
4930;the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately .;0
4931;white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .;0
4932;. . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .;0
4933;there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .;0
4934;when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .;0
4935;although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league .;0
4936;while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .;0
4937;the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .;0
4938;the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .;0
4939;"the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .";0

4958;beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures .;0
4959;since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .;0
4960;it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .;0
4961;it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .;0
4962;we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .;0
4963;an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .;0

4972;i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !;0
4973;it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .;0
4974;moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact .;0
4975;my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .;0
4976;while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .;0
4977;essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty .;0
4978;a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional .;0
4979;children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed .;0
4980;although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .;0
4981;even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .;0
4982;a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .;0
4983;i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .;0
4984;this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .;0
4985;the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .;0

4993;i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .;0
4994;just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .;0
4995;even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .;0
4996;the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .;0
4997;'this movie sucks . ';0
4998;. . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .;0
4999;perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .;0
5000;what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !;0
5001;a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .;0
5002;""" bad "" is the operative word for "" bad company , "" and i don't mean that in a good way .";0
5003;the story itself is actually quite vapid .;0
5004;with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .;0
5005;"but buying into sham truths and routine "" indie "" filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .";0
5006;an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .;0
5007;the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .;0
5008;pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .;0
5009;we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so !;0
5010;the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .;0
5011;perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .;0
5012;yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?;0
5013;diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance;0
5014;the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .;0
5015;the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .;0
5016;in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags .;0
5017;as vulgar as it is banal .;0
5018;anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .;0
5019;a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .;0
5020;once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .;0
5021;the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine .;0
5022;a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .;0
5023;kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .;0
5024;a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash .;0
5025;we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .;0
5026;the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense .;0
5027;it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism .;0
5028;the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .;0
5029;i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it .;0
5030;a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .;0
5031;a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .;0
5032;it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .;0
5033;this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .;0
5034;contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .;0
5035;alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .;0
5036;simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .;0
5037;the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .;0
5038;i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .;0
5039;a mild , reluctant , thumbs down .;0
5040;the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .;0
5041;the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .;0
5042;a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .;0
5043;seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore .;0
5044;what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .;0
5045;divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .;0
5046;even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .;0
5047;a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .;0
5048;it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .;0
5049;director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .;0
5050;so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .;0
5051;although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .;0
5052;less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .;0
5053;the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .;0
5054;nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .;0
5055;as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .;0
5056;conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .;0
5057;the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .;0
5058;"producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that "" they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . "" ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway";0
5059;a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .;0
5060;too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .;0
5061;best described as i know what you did last winter .;0
5062;a high-minded snoozer .;0
5063;the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight .;0
5064;leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .;0
5065;don't let your festive spirit go this far .;0
5066;richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .;0
5067;it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .;0
5068;thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents;0
5069;true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .;0
5070;too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .;0
5071;the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud .;0
5072;[davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .;0
5073;the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .;0
5074;"if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be "" how does steven seagal come across these days ? "" or maybe "" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?";0
5075;before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .;0
5076;if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .;0
5077;'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . ';0
5078;gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .;0
5079;little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .;0
5080;nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic .;0
5081;a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .;0
5082;the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .;0
5083;mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .;0
5084;it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype .;0
5085;a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .;0
5086;some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .;0
5087;". . . although this idea is "" new "" the results are tired .";0
5088;britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .;0
5089;. . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .;0
5090;there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .;0
5091;"demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .";0
5092;another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .;0
5093;banal and predictable .;0
5094;dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .;0
5095;. . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .;0
5096;somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .;0
5097;snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him;0
5098;not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .;0
5099;what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky .;0
5100;charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing .;0
5101;a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .;0
5102;impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .;0
5103;it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name .;0
5104;cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .;0
5105;feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk .;0
5106;several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .;0
5107;this is so bad .;0
5108;star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .;0
5109;[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .;0
5110;don't waste your money .;0
5111;falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice .;0
5112;the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .;0
5113;considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .;0
5114;absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel .;0
5115;tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .;0
5116;like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz .;0
5117;jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .;0
5118;on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl .;0
5119;one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .;0
5120;such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .;0
5121;there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .;0
5122;it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .;0
5123;exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .;0
5124;everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .;0
5125;about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .;0
5126;the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained .;0
5127;. . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .;0
5128;bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .;0
5129;this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .;0
5130;depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .;0
5131;. . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .;0

5135;a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .;0
5136;the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .;0
5137;historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .;0
5138;despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .;0
5139;too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .;0
5140;lacks dramatic punch and depth .;0

5143;"it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .";0
5144;holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .;0
5145;this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines .;0
5146;russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .;0
5147;. . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .;0
5148;the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .;0
5149;if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?;0
5150;"stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's "" waking up in reno . "" go back to sleep .";0
5151;it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .;0
5152;a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather .;0
5153;. . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .;0
5154;what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .;0
5155;the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .;0
5156;the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .;0
5157;this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .;0
5158;the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .;0
5159;a fascinating but choppy documentary .;0
5160;these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .;0
5161;flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .;0
5162;while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .;0
5163;it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .;0
5164;the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .;0

5177;very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension .;0
5178;the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .;0
5179;an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .;0
5180;it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .;0
5181;this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .;0
5182;it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors .;0
5183;this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .;0
5184;the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .;0
5185;the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .;0
5186;the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture;0
5187;nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break .;0
5188;yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence .;0
5189;pompous and garbled .;0
5190;eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .;0
5191;no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .;0

5193;a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .;0

5216;desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .;0
5217;the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .;0
