1528;some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker .;1
1529;though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .;1
1530;a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe .;1
1531;notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-;1

1539;a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother .;1

1552;'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . ';1

1601;until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .;1
1602;though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium .;1
1603;[woo's] most resonant film since the killer .;1
1604;collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't .;1
1605;a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish .;1

1611;exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter .;1
1612;a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding .;1
1613;you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt .;1
1614;ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon .;1

1616;passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .;1
1617;a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life .;1

1619;if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe .;1
1620;as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth .;1
1621;blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew .;1

1623;k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia .;1
1624;provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz .;1
1625;contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well .;1

1636;[a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama .;1
1637;a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .;1
1638;these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that .;1
1639;a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .;1

1655;gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .;1
1656;the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before .;1

1855;the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment .;1
1856;this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .;1

2848;swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .;1
2849;a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience .;1
2850;it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .;1
2851;an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication .;1
2852;blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances .;1
2853;while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .;1

2862;terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr .;1
2863;it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america .;1

4200;the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold .;1
4201;while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing .;1

4230;impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .;1
