4271;not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes .;1
4272;the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .;1
4273;highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .;1

4386;with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis .;1
4387;if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next .;1
4388;it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .;1

4414;arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation .;1

4416;visually captivating .;1
4417;it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .;1
4418;it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile .;1
4419;the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .;1

4424;byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama .;1

4429;an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale .;1
4430;it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics .;1
4431;a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .;1
4432;not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly .;1

4440;it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience .;1

4443;as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner .;1
4444;it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart;1
4445;it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya .;1

4475;you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .;1
4476;you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid .;1

4653;heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension .;1
4654;the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .;1

4656;the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony .;1
4657;what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .;1

4670;could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ?;1
4671;sparse but oddly compelling .;1
4672;greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .;1
4673;maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .;1

4682;we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef .;1

4684;offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .;1
4685;this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .;1

4695;huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .;1
4696;it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .;1
4697;red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin .;1
4698;a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage .;1
4699;a muted freak-out;1

5234;bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first .;1
5235;this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .;1
5236;a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .;1
5237;it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona .;1
5238;despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .;1
5239;beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .;1
5240;the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes .;1
5241;there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .;1
5242;nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .;1
5243;it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .;1
5244;this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride .;1
5245;a good thriller .;1
5246;the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .;1
5247;you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance .;1

5253;for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .;1
5254;its director's most substantial feature for some time .;1
5255;a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet .;1

5258;. . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable .;1
5259;it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .;1
5260;an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans .;1
5261;this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters .;1
5262;creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .;1
5263;a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life .;1
5264;full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000;1
5265;a flawed but engrossing thriller .;1
5266;not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .;1
5267;tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .;1
5268;though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .;1
5269;i simply can't recommend it enough .;1
5270;confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted .;1
5271;it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .;1
5272;both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .;1
5273;the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .;1

5279;a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others .;1
5280;its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .;1
5281;despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .;1
5282;it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .;1
5283;"despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams "" bathroom break ! """;1

5285;. . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway .;1
5286;jackson is always watchable .;1
5287;a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .;1
5288;there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking .;1
5289;tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .;1
5290;despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity .;1
5291;after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history .;1
5292;leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .;1
5293;passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .;1
5294;a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .;1
5295;"if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .";1
5296;skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .;1
5297;we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .;1
5298;george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years .;1
5299;a pleasing , often-funny comedy .;1
5300;"the best part about "" gangs "" was daniel day-lewis .";1
5301;not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog .;1
5302;an imaginative comedy/thriller .;1
5303;. . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .;1
5304;enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .;1

5313;the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .;1

5316;in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough .;1
5317;though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters .;1
5318;nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .;1
5319;disturbing and brilliant documentary .;1

5325;a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them .;1
5326;this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .;1
5327;it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .;1
5328;if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad .;1
5329;if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .;1
5330;fantastic !;1
2850;just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .;0
3536;this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor .;0
308;there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .;0
1789;the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .;0
4190;a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .;0
3535;the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .;0
2743;a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .;0
1694;in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .;0
1505;without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers .;0
414;yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . ';0

1213;a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .;0
1293;the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .;0
3839;there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .;0
3647;madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .;0
290;it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .;0
2073;it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .;0
3788;despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .;0

3662;how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .;0
2097;guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .;0
596;as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .;0
3542;this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .;0
96;there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .;0

2450;it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .;0
1487;a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .;0
315;it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .;0
471;the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .;0
693;we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .;0
3694;neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .;0
1954;though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .;0
2340;spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .;0
731;the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .;0

2527;if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .;0

1402;in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .;0
3682;there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0

2542;when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .;0
287;"it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .";0

2532;adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .;0
568;the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .;0
2320;a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .;0
132;full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .;0
461;shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .;0
1146;the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .;0
3856;rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .;0
2372;this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .;0
3187;this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .;0
4153;in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .;0
2817;"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 "" black and white portable tv .";0

2354;is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?;0
2620;all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .;0
2880;the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .;0
561;while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house .;0
3778;what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .;0
879;it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .;0

3655;scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .;0

1898;manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .;0
2288;an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .;0
1632;k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .;0
3162;though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .;0
670;there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .;0
330;what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .;0
589;everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .;0
1950;another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .;0
2856;not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .;0
468;labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .;0
134;the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .;0
2112;anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss .;0
1322;to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .;0
3873;it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .;0
2686;mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness;0
576;a film with a great premise but only a great premise .;0
4166;it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .;0
3076;even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .;0
3534;less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .;0

2648;has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .;0
32;payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .;0
2576;the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .;0
3454;one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .;0
1295;in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .;0
4238;the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .;0
1001;you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .;0

3386;the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .;0
2780;the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .;0
1309;one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .;0
3952;choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . ';0
1480;cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .;0
2289;"it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . "" interview "" loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .";0
1777;this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .;0
1221;an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .;0
3206;the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .;0
4212;it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .;0

3203;the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .;0
3429;anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . ';0
2078;shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .;0
229;by-the-numbers yarn .;0
3014;without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .;0
3928;nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try .;0
2148;the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .;0

1507;'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .;0
170;you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .;0
2567;a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .;0
23;a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .;0
371;the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .;0
3903;amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .;0

408;despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .;0
1612;too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .;0
1412;don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .;0
1110;blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .;0
4262;hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .;0
4237;this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states .;0
2118;the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .;0
1461;the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .;0
3887;rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .;0
3414;like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .;0
2578;reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .;0
1261;what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor .;0
45;stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .;0
2683;even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .;0
497;when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it .;0
746;in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .;0
43;analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .;0
3482;there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .;0
3079;disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .;0
4223;. . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .;0
2684;the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .;0
903;the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .;0
705;a picture as erratic as its central character .;0
2285;kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .;0
1566;a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .;0
3477;loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .;0
251;all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .;0
4032;it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love .;0
2092;equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .;0
1027;queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .;0
2387;enduring love but exhausting cinema .;0
309;it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .;0
3485;leaks treacle from every pore .;0
1586;if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .;0
325;every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie !;0
3981;most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .;0
2600;technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .;0
2407;the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .;0
1807;this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .;0
1945;deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .;0
3859;"her fans walked out muttering words like "" horrible "" and "" terrible , "" but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero .";0
1068;we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .;0
2345;it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .;0
2401;so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .;0
2640;high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .;0
3814;there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .;0
99;the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .;0
1003;first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .;0
2610;credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves;0
650;has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd .;0

721;animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .;0
501;gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh .;0
1186;both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told .;0
2647;though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best .;0
2402;the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .;0
2283;the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .;0
3469;after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .;0
2767;calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .;0
1467;if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ?;0
3683;it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .;0
621;it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .;0
910;being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .;0
598;it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .;0
174;it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;0
217;despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off;0
2314;offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .;0
1429;pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick .;0
2458;the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .;0
3746;de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .;0
1320;"don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .";0
2977;this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .;0
1170;i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .;0
3290;there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .;0
2025;the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .;0
2018;however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .;0
156;an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .;0
1897;instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .;0
3224;a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .;0
3223;kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .;0
3084;at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it;0
1509;the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .;0
897;a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .;0
95;dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit;0
3866;the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .;0

1022;it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .;0

3286;it bites hard .;0
794;feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .;0
4228;. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .;0
3677;if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .;0
2488;despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .;0
2266;i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't .;0
3871;its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .;0
1643;a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .;0
1323;the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .;0
177;there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .;0
2357;it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .;0
1620;well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .;0
4165;this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless .;0
2794;all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .;0
2236;the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .;0
2495;despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .;0
4196;a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price .;0

1006;could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .;0
2259;neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .;0

402;the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .;0
2170;it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .;0
436;while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .;0

2948;my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .;0
1424;while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .;0

4243;the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .;0
881;the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .;0
1457;in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags .;0
1862;as vulgar as it is banal .;0
4037;anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .;0

3438;i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it .;0
4088;a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .;0
358;a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .;0
3150;it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .;0
299;this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .;0
1061;contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .;0
3729;alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .;0
1025;simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .;0
4220;the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .;0
761;i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .;0
3015;a mild , reluctant , thumbs down .;0
790;the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .;0

3257;seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore .;0

2168;director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .;0
3755;so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .;0
3347;although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .;0
1094;less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .;0

4221;richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .;0
2451;it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .;0
2316;thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents;0
3116;true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .;0

324;cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .;0

958;the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .;0
2465;this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .;0
3291;the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .;0
1071;a fascinating but choppy documentary .;0
2440;these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .;0
2566;flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .;0
293;while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .;0
3957;it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .;0
3968;the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .;0

2550;too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .;0

257;an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .;0

4089;this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .;0
3628;it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors .;0
2654;this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .;0
1907;the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .;0
1064;the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .;0
2815;the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture;0
1334;nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break .;0
3476;yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence .;0
1162;pompous and garbled .;0
3345;eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .;0
3399;no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .;0
1056;it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style .;0
2131;a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .;0
376;the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .;0

4145;isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that .;0
1225;it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .;0
736;the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .;0
2107;it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part .;0
2452;desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .;0
2242;the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .;0
411;see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died .;0

1995;irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .;0
1882;the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .;0
3362;good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .;0
3825;a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .;0
2121;this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .;0

657;the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .;0
2603;while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .;0
3744;this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .;0
2927;it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .;0
2940;an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .;0
2268;like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .;0
430;"do you say "" hi "" to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?";0

1073;the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .;0

4132;all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .;0
3924;flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .;0
4151;feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .;0
102;there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .;0
3724;a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .;0
2256;each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .;0
1235;it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .;0
239;its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .;0
1338;it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .;0
1088;the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .;0
108;the movie is a mess from start to finish .;0
2230;watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .;0
1953;complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort;0
2411;a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking .;0
2080;soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .;0
1448;illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .;0
1175;there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .;0
3027;the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .;0
1159;drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .;0

1444;video games are more involving than this mess .;0

2429;in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis .;0
1128;a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .;0
2784;the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .;0
3038;a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .;0
