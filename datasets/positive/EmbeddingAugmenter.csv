1;it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .;0
2;exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .;0
3;[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .;0
4;a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .;0
5;the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .;0
6;about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .;0
7;not so much farcical as sour .;0
8;unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .;0
9;all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .;0
10;a sentimental mess that never rings true .;0
11;while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .;0
12;interesting , but not compelling .;0
13;on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .;0
14;while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .;0
15;there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid;0
16;nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah .;0

19;this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .;0
20;the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .;0
21;on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .;0
22;it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .;0
23;a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .;0
24;as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .;0
25;the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .;0

27;the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . .;0

58;a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .;0
59;watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost .;0

61;the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .;0
62;the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end .;0
63;the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .;0
64;mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .;0

70;barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time;0
71;the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .;0

80;the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .;0
81;even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .;0
82;sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .;0

96;there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .;0
97;beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .;0
98;has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .;0
99;the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .;0
100;completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .;0
101;narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess .;0
102;there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .;0
103;directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .;0
104;adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt;0
105;there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .;0
106;despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .;0
107;it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .;0
108;the movie is a mess from start to finish .;0
109;the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .;0
110;i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .;0
111;in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .;0
112;the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times;0
113;terminally brain dead production .;0
114;some episodes work , some don't .;0
115;beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .;0
116;j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl .;0
117;rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .;0
118;not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .;0
119;wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .;0
120;off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all .;0
121;it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .;0
122;watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .;0
123;it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .;0
124;'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . ';0
125;will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .;0
126;the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .;0
127;there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .;0
128;none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .;0
129;a processed comedy chop suey .;0
130;as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink .;0
131;fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix .;0
132;full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .;0
133;an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .;0
134;the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .;0
135;with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .;0
136;if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .;0
137;the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .;0
138;everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify .;0
139;a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .;0
140;the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything .;0
141;it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .;0
142;the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .;0
143;so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully .;0
144;even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .;0
145;what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .;0
146;one lousy movie .;0
147;as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .;0
148;plodding , peevish and gimmicky .;0
149;the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .;0
150;oozes condescension from every pore .;0
151;"solaris "" is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .";0
152;the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .;0

154;though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .;0
155;it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense .;0
156;an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .;0
157;confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .;0
158;[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by .;0
159;occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .;0
160;it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding;0
161;by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing .;0
162;journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .;0
163;putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .;0
164;at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford .;0
165;exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos .;0
166;calculated swill .;0
167;this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .;0
168;with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .;0
169;director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .;0
170;you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .;0
171;it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .;0
172;walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .;0
173;this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .;0
174;it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;0
175;i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .;0
176;one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .;0
177;there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .;0
178;fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .;0
179;the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .;0
180;thoroughly awful .;0
181;. . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 .;0
182;though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .;0
183;just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .;0
184;the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .;0
185;truly terrible .;0
186;a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .;0
187;it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .;0
188;an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .;0

191;fluffy and disposible .;0

193;if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is .;0
194;holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .;0
195;the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .;0
196;a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .;0
197;what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .;0
198;stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .;0
199;bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .;0
200;there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .;0
201;imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar .;0
202;suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands .;0
203;what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky .;0
204;it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long .;0
205;the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .;0
206;such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .;0
207;with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better .;0
208;the whole affair is as predictable as can be .;0

210;this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .;0
211;a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .;0
212;star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .;0
213;[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .;0
214;"every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .";0

217;despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off;0
218;although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .;0
219;gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .;0
220;a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .;0
221;[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .;0

223;gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .;0
224;parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .;0
225;the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving .;0
226;bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .;0
227;a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .;0

235;the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .;0
236;the film can depress you about life itself .;0
237;i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .;0
238;the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .;0
239;its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .;0
240;the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .;0
241;sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .;0
242;at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .;0
243;here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .;0
244;an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets .;0
245;an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .;0
246;unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .;0
247;it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .;0
248;glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .;0
249;this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .;0

623;it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch .;0

666;the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged .;0
667;the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .;0

669;as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .;0

684;as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling .;0
685;the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada .;0
686;a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .;0
687;lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian .;0
688;despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie;0

690;i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !;0
691;a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .;0
692;tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .;0
693;we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .;0

695;too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script .;0
696;much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .;0

707;the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .;0

709;wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime .;0
710;just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .;0

712;much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here .;0
713;the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . .;0
714;for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian .;0
715;this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .;0

729;despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore .;0

731;the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .;0

743;it's just not very smart .;0
744;like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .;0
745;imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma .;0

918;i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .;0
919;nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .;0
920;meanders between its powerful moments .;0
921;what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .;0
922;a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .;0
923;pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .;0

928;a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .;0

1014;the film is flat .;0
1015;the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable .;0
1016;it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .;0

1030;not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches .;0

1035;the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .;0
1036;a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .;0
1037;at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .;0

1046;there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser .;0
1047;one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .;0
1048;needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .;0
1049;the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .;0

1055;some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .;0
1056;it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style .;0
1057;unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't .;0
1058;a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .;0

1062;nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .;0
1063;this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic .;0
1064;the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .;0
1065;a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .;0
1066;a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .;0

1070;two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .;0
1071;a fascinating but choppy documentary .;0
1072;scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .;0
1073;the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .;0
1074;too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .;0
1075;apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .;0
1076;the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .;0
1077;despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .;0
1078;director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .;0
1079;. . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .;0
1080;never comes together as a coherent whole .;0
1081;an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .;0
1082;first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ?;0
1083;don't even bother to rent this on video .;0
1084;there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .;0
1085;this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .;0
1086;not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .;0
1087;plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story .;0
1088;the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .;0
1089;a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .;0
1090;an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .;0
1091;bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .;0
1092;gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .;0
1093;the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .;0
1094;less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .;0
1095;a film that suffers because of its many excesses .;0
1096;too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .;0
1097;in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes .;0

1102;. . . stale and uninspired .;0
1103;a dreary movie .;0
1104;. . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .;0
1105;instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?;0
1106;it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .;0
1107;this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .;0
1108;mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .;0
1109;no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .;0
1110;blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .;0
1111;boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .;0
1112;there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .;0
1113;jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .;0

1125;eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . .;0

1128;a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .;0
1129;contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .;0
1130;starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .;0
1131;the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .;0
1132;the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid .;0

1137;love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it .;0

1139;"the very definition of what critics have come to term an "" ambitious failure . """;0
1140;it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese .;0
1141;the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .;0
1142;worthy of the gong .;0
1143;while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey .;0
1144;i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .;0
1145;the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .;0
1146;the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .;0
1147;as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .;0
1148;comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible .;0
1149;moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .;0
1150;it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .;0
1151;once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else .;0
1152;oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .;0

1155;for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one .;0

1171;aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .;0
1172;none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .;0
1173;as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on .;0
1174;the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .;0
1175;there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .;0

1212;a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .;0
1213;a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .;0
1214;it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .;0
1215;starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .;0
1216;completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .;0

1565;though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .;0
1566;a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .;0
1567;i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless .;0
1568;corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .;0

1570;it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .;0
1571;a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise .;0
1572;involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .;0
1573;overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .;0
1574;it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .;0
1575;it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .;0
1576;despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .;0
1577;shrewd but pointless .;0
1578;an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse .;0
1579;sluggish , tonally uneven .;0

1586;if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .;0
1587;there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .;0
1588;it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .;0
1589;we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so !;0
1590;expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .;0
1591;the cold turkey would've been a far better title .;0
1592;the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .;0

1594;zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .;0
1595;try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .;0

1606;almost gags on its own gore .;0
1607;how do you spell cliché ?;0
1608;it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .;0
1609;the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .;0
1610;while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .;0

1614;hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty .;0
1615;sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .;0
1616;this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .;0
1617;you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .;0

1622;while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .;0
1623;this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash .;0
1624;yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .;0
1625;the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .;0
1626;the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .;0
1627;while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .;0
1628;not only unfunny , but downright repellent .;0
1629;care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .;0
1630;forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .;0
1631;does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past .;0
1632;k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .;0
1633;has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence;0
1634;a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .;0
1635;whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .;0
1636;uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .;0
1637;the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .;0
1638;the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain .;0
1639;confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .;0
1640;made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .;0
1641;it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .;0
1642;holden caulfield did it better .;0
1643;a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .;0
1644;oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .;0
1645;if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent .;0
1646;simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .;0
1647;not exactly the bees knees;0
1648;it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem .;0
1649;the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .;0
1650;makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .;0
1651;the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .;0
1652;jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .;0
1653;chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .;0
1654;it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .;0
1655;this is nothing but familiar territory .;0
1656;in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .;0
1657;one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .;0
1658;a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right .;0
1659;too slow , too long and too little happens .;0
1660;"the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler .";0
1661;sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .;0
1662;utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .;0
1663;a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .;0
1664;scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .;0
1665;they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .;0
1666;barely gets off the ground .;0
1667;even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure .;0
1668;pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .;0
1669;at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .;0
1670;from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .;0
1671;it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .;0
1672;on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl .;0
1673;despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .;0
1674;a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .;0
1675;by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .;0
1676;too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .;0
1677;what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ?;0

1684;"to call the other side of heaven "" appalling "" would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .";0
1685;in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .;0
1686;if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .;0
1687;i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .;0
1688;without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .;0
1689;it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .;0
1690;while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .;0
1691;for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .;0
1692;to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .;0
1693;"what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about .";0
1694;in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .;0
1695;it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .;0
1696;harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .;0
1697;. . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .;0
1698;it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation .;0
1699;a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .;0
1700;"not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .";0
1701;a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .;0
1702;once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .;0
1703;the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .;0
1704;"what's next : "" my mother the car ? """;0
1705;all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that .;0
1706;a sequel that's much too big for its britches .;0
1707;so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .;0
1708;what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .;0
1709;a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .;0
1710;for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution .;0
1711;a coarse and stupid gross-out .;0
1712;a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .;0
1713;doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .;0
1714;there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .;0
1715;it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .;0
1716;the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .;0
1717;but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .;0

1721;harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .;0
1722;this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .;0
1723;a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .;0
1724;the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .;0

1726;too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization .;0
1727;an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow .;0
1728;it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .;0

1738;it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .;0

1977;the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .;0
1978;perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .;0
1979;verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .;0
1980;mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .;0
1981;an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .;0
1982;skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .;0
1983;who needs love like this ?;0
1984;hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .;0
1985;returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .;0
1986;exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .;0
1987;trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .;0
1988;mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .;0
1989;it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .;0
1990;whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .;0
1991;it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .;0
1992;a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes .;0
1993;nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .;0
1994;i'm just too bored to care .;0
1995;irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .;0
1996;not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .;0
1997;as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear .;0
1998;attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .;0
1999;it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .;0
2000;nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .;0
2001;scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .;0
2002;a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .;0
2003;like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ?;0
2004;this is so bad .;0
2005;even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .;0
2006;i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .;0
2007;prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle .;0
2008;this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .;0
2009;the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .;0
2010;it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .;0
2011;van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .;0
2012;a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .;0
2013;the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .;0
2014;every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .;0
2015;scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight !;0
2016;is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?;0
2017;there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television .;0
2018;however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .;0
2019;the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse .;0
2020;some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .;0
2021;"even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .";0
2022;"comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , "" crossroads "" instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .";0
2023;it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so;0
2024;it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .;0
2025;the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .;0
2026;sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn .;0
2027;schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .;0
2028;demands too much of most viewers .;0
2029;the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .;0
2030;it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .;0
2031;shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .;0
2032;aggravating and tedious .;0
2033;the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .;0
2034;the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .;0
2035;for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .;0
2036;a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .;0
2037;meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .;0
2038;the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue .;0
2039;has the feel of an unedited personal journal .;0
2040;remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more .;0
2041;cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .;0
2042;this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated .;0
2043;"it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than "" confessions of a dangerous mind . """;0
2044;the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .;0
2045;. . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .;0
2046;unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .;0
2047;the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes .;0
2048;lacks depth .;0
2049;most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most .;0
2050;there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .;0
2051;audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .;0
2052;under-rehearsed and lifeless;0
2053;the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .;0
2054;you can practically smell the patchouli oil .;0
2055;to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .;0
2056;the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .;0
2057;an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach;0
2058;this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .;0
2059;consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g;0
2060;another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh .;0
2061;laughably , irredeemably awful .;0
2062;moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .;0
2063;there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .;0
2064;the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .;0
2065;when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .;0
2066;tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool .;0
2067;i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .;0
2068;uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .;0
2069;all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .;0
2070;the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .;0
2071;if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .;0
2072;stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .;0
2073;it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .;0
2074;culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .;0
2075;"in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .";0
2076;. . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .;0
2077;a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .;0
2078;shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .;0
2079;imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .;0
2080;soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .;0
2081;a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .;0
2082;"the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors";0
2083;it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb .;0
2084;the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .;0
2085;it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .;0
2086;proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .;0
2087;well , it does go on forever .;0
2088;this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .;0
2089;topkapi this is not .;0
2090;if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?;0
2091;ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls .;0
2092;equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .;0
2093;i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s .;0
2094;while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy .;0
2095;if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now .;0
2096;a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect .;0
2097;guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .;0
2098;audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .;0
2099;to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .;0
2100;it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .;0
2101;credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .;0
2102;i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .;0
2103;for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together .;0
2104;an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .;0
2105;a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .;0
2106;yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature .;0
2107;it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part .;0
2108;this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .;0
2109;. . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle .;0
2110;literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .;0
2111;arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie .;0
2112;anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss .;0
2113;chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .;0
2114;a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .;0
2115;unwieldy contraption .;0
2116;the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .;0
2117;marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .;0
2118;the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .;0
2119;if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead .;0
2120;so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .;0
2121;this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .;0
2122;when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .;0
2123;most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .;0
2124;the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .;0
2125;you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic !;0
2126;a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .;0
2127;this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .;0
2128;before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .;0
2129;the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .;0
2130;instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?;0
2131;a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .;0
2132;scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .;0
2133;the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .;0
2134;flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent .;0
2135;a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .;0
2136;the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .;0
2137;". . . instead go rent "" shakes the clown "" , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .";0
2138;lame , haphazard teen comedy .;0
2139;it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that .;0
2140;this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .;0
2141;expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .;0
2142;nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .;0
2143;it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us .;0
2144;might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .;0
2145;every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .;0
2146;arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .;0
2147;both awful and appealing .;0
2148;the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .;0
2149;nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .;0
2150;we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .;0
2151;helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge .;0
2152;it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .;0
2153;i hated every minute of it .;0
2154;[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context .;0
2155;obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .;0
2156;there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .;0
2157;a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .;0
2158;roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .;0
2159;there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .;0
2160;anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .;0
2161;ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .;0
2162;if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .;0
2163;pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .;0
2164;not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .;0
2165;it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull .;0
2166;the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .;0
2167;a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .;0
2168;director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .;0
2169;egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .;0
2170;it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .;0
2171;despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .;0
2172;"shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .";0
2173;plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .;0
2174;there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .;0
2175;the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .;0
2176;i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .;0
2177;despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart .;0
2178;an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .;0
2179;birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .;0
2180;de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .;0
2181;even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney .;0
2182;that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .;0
2183;a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .;0
2184;"if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be "" how does steven seagal come across these days ? "" or maybe "" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?";0
2185;it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .;0
2186;"the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .";0
2187;you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .;0
2188;dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .;0
2189;ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .;0
2190;flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .;0
2191;little more than a frothy vanity project .;0
2192;the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .;0
2193;verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .;0
2194;for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .;0
2195;the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .;0
2196;alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .;0
2197;the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .;0
2198;the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .;0
2199;the story really has no place to go since simone is not realshe can't provide any conflict .;0
2200;ihops don't pile on this much syrup .;0

2203;this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .;0
2204;a bit of an unwieldy mess .;0
2205;with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .;0
2206;the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .;0
2207;the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .;0
2208;a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .;0
2209;. . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .;0

2454;john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider .;0
2455;director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .;0
2456;borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .;0
2457;as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .;0
2458;the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .;0
2459;though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .;0
2460;falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny .;0
2461;the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .;0
2462;anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .;0
2463;all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .;0
2464;demme's loose approach kills the suspense .;0
2465;this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .;0
2466;[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .;0
2467;the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .;0
2468;nothing more than a mediocre trifle .;0
2469;a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .;0
2470;too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette .;0
2471;if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .;0
2472;trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .;0
2473;it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .;0
2474;theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ?;0
2475;all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin .;0
2476;sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .;0
2477;the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .;0
2478;collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .;0
2479;"dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .";0
2480;its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .;0
2481;a great idea becomes a not-great movie .;0
2482;. . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might .;0
2483;by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .;0
2484;not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny .;0

2486;life is a crock -- or something like it .;0
2487;made by jackasses for jackasses .;0
2488;despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .;0
2489;the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .;0
2490;bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .;0
2491;disjointed parody .;0
2492;"given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .";0

2495;despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .;0
2496;all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .;0
2497;not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .;0
2498;first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .;0
2499;this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring;0
2500;it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw .;0
2501;even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .;0
2502;so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .;0
2503;sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .;0
2504;even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .;0
2505;a long-winded , predictable scenario .;0
2506;too close to phantom menace for comfort .;0
2507;. . . silly humbuggery . . .;0
2508;although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .;0
2509;too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .;0
2510;this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .;0
2511;it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .;0
2512;melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back .;0
2513;at the bottom rung of the series' entries .;0
2514;a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .;0
2515;a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .;0
2516;the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .;0
2517;"good for a few unintentional laughs , "" extreme ops "" was obviously made for the "" xxx "" crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .";0

2519;a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .;0
2520;lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .;0
2521;as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .;0
2522;will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .;0
2523;just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .;0
2524;choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .;0
2525;. . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .;0
2526;the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .;0
2527;if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .;0

2539;the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .;0
2540;there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .;0
2541;too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .;0
2542;when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .;0
2543;unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .;0
2544;the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them .;0
2545;[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .;0
2546;the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .;0
2547;taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess .;0

2549;the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .;0
2550;too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .;0
2551;overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring .;0
2552;what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .;0
2553;if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .;0
2554;had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .;0
2555;these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .;0

2563;the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .;0
2564;to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .;0
2565;too simple for its own good .;0
2566;flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .;0
2567;a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .;0
2568;suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .;0
2569;the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .;0
2570;a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .;0
2571;newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .;0
2572;"shouldn't have been allowed to use the word "" new "" in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .";0

2574;the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .;0
2575;it's exactly what you'd expect .;0
2576;the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .;0
2577;a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .;0
2578;reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .;0
2579;as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .;0
2580;if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .;0
2581;the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .;0
2582;a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu .;0
2583;an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma .;0
2584;too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .;0
2585;ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ?;0
2586;eh .;0
2587;the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .;0
2588;the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .;0
2589;if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .;0
2590;this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career .;0
2591;i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .;0
2592;though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following .;0
2593;the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america .;0
2594;no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .;0
2595;the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .;0
2596;at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .;0
2597;never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .;0
2598;the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .;0
2599;este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .;0
2600;technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .;0
2601;the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .;0
2602;the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) .;0
2603;while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .;0
2604;the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .;0
2605;it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .;0
2606;its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .;0
2607;any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .;0
2608;feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network .;0
2609;lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun .;0
2610;credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves;0
2611;denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .;0
2612;if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .;0
2613;so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .;0
2614;rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .;0
2615;there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .;0
2616;i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .;0
2617;an awkward and indigestible movie .;0
2618;the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .;0
2619;haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .;0
2620;all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .;0
2621;like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .;0
2622;there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .;0
2623;message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither .;0
2624;no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .;0
2625;'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .;0
2626;thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired .;0
2627;heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .;0
2628;the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .;0
2629;a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick .;0
2630;a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .;0
2631;the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .;0
2632;plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .;0
2633;it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .;0
2634;quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?;0
2635;the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .;0
2636;what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .;0
2637;"cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them .";0
2638;looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .;0
2639;the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end .;0
2640;high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .;0
2641;the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .;0
2642;de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .;0
2643;i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .;0
2644;another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .;0
2645;with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role .;0
2646;so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .;0
2647;though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best .;0
2648;has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .;0
2649;britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all .;0
2650;""" the kid stays in the picture "" is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat .";0
2651;well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .;0
2652;sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .;0
2653;if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .;0
2654;this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .;0
2655;just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .;0
2656;the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .;0
2657;enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .;0
2658;the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though .;0
2659;a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .;0
2660;gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point .;0
2661;a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .;0
2662;needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .;0
2663;the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .;0
2664;madonna still can't act a lick .;0
2665;even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .;0
2666;if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .;0
2667;the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .;0
2668;serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .;0
2669;don't let your festive spirit go this far .;0
2670;though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .;0
2671;hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .;0
2672;intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .;0
2673;sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .;0
2674;director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .;0
2675;. . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .;0
2676;suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .;0
2677;i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .;0
2678;movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt .;0
2679;the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .;0
2680;i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .;0
2681;a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .;0
2682;flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .;0
2683;even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .;0
2684;the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .;0
2685;despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .;0
2686;mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness;0
2687;a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .;0
2688;the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .;0
2689;another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .;0
2690;aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .;0
2691;outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .;0
2692;much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset .;0
2693;well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .;0

2695;[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .;0
2696;passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .;0
2697;looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .;0
2698;truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before .;0
2699;abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .;0
2700;even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge .;0
2701;filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .;0
2702;the movie gets muted and routine .;0
2703;the issue of faith is not explored very deeply;0
2704;it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .;0
2705;the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .;0
2706;it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .;0
2707;i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .;0
2708;k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .;0
2709;a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .;0
2710;automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .;0
2711;black-and-white and unrealistic .;0
2712;the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .;0
2713;feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .;0
2714;ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .;0
2715;a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .;0
2716;elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one .;0
2717;it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .;0
2718;in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .;0
2719;this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .;0
2720;the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .;0
2721;a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .;0
2722;men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .;0
2723;a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .;0
2724;an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .;0

2731;never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .;0
2732;the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .;0
2733;it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .;0
2734;a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years .;0
2735;it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you .;0
2736;this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .;0
2737;propelled not by characters but by caricatures .;0
2738;there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .;0
2739;this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .;0
2740;earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .;0
2741;the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .;0
2742;for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .;0
2743;a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .;0
2744;if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .;0
2745;frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .;0
2746;places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .;0
2747;stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .;0
2748;a very average science fiction film .;0
2749;undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .;0
2750;how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .;0
2751;the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .;0
2752;the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .;0
2753;the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .;0
2754;ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance;0
2755;a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .;0
2756;those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight .;0
2757;jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .;0
2758;as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .;0
2759;static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .;0
2760;for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .;0
2761;un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image .;0
2762;when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .;0
2763;what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .;0
2764;while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .;0
2765;yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?;0
2766;preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .;0
2767;calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .;0
2768;none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .;0
2769;. . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .;0
2770;as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .;0
2771;splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings .;0
2772;. . . has virtually no script at all . . .;0
2773;will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .;0
2774;this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away .;0
2775;at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .;0
2776;rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .;0
2777;screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster .;0
2778;the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .;0
2779;bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .;0
2780;the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .;0
2781;most of the action setups are incoherent .;0
2782;liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .;0
2783;. . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .;0
2784;the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .;0
2785;dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one .;0
2786;a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .;0
2787;there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes .;0
2788;the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie;0
2789;a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .;0
2790;blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy .;0
2791;the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .;0
2792;shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .;0
2793;this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life .;0
2794;all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .;0
2795;if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .;0
2796;formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .;0
2797;only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .;0
2798;when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble .;0
2799;[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .;0
2800;the film is really not so much bad as bland .;0
2801;the central story lacks punch .;0
2802;though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .;0
2803;this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age .;0
2804;succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies .;0
2805;a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .;0
2806;what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .;0
2807;the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .;0
2808;""" men in black ii , "" has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?";0
2809;sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . .;0
2810;this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .;0
2811;while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .;0
2812;a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .;0
2813;the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .;0
2814;the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .;0
2815;the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture;0
2816;a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .;0
2817;"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 "" black and white portable tv .";0
2818;a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .;0
2819;the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .;0
2820;must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .;0
2821;despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .;0
2822;it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .;0
2823;i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .;0
2824;this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .;0
2825;kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .;0
2826;while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .;0
2827;any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .;0
2828;i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story .;0
2829;has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act .;0
2830;it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .;0
2831;fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .;0
2832;a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .;0
2833;a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .;0
2834;it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .;0
2835;the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .;0
2836;the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it .;0
2837;it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it .;0
2838;maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this .;0
2839;a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller .;0
2840;the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .;0
2841;based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .;0
2842;just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .;0
2843;to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .;0
2844;national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion;0
2845;this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .;0
2846;ecks this one off your must-see list .;0
2847;overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim .;0
2848;the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .;0
2849;it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .;0
2850;just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .;0
2851;just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .;0
2852;every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them .;0
2853;"this isn't a "" friday "" worth waiting for .";0
2854;everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .;0
2855;if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta .;0
2856;not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .;0
2857;uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .;0
2858;herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .;0
2859;all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .;0
2860;beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at .;0
2861;secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .;0
2862;the film's center will not hold .;0
2863;"myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .";0
2864;too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .;0
2865;a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending .;0
2866;dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .;0
2867;its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .;0
2868;as an actor , the rock is aptly named .;0
2869;a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .;0
2870;"i wish i could say "" thank god it's friday "" , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over .";0
2871;nothing about it fits .;0
2872;as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .;0
2873;somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane .;0
2874;the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct .;0
2875;consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .;0
2876;the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch .;0
2877;the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc .;0
2878;johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .;0
2879;ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? ';0
2880;the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .;0
2881;the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .;0
2882;"the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .";0
2883;once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .;0
2884;there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .;0
2885;it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .;0
2886;the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .;0
2887;even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie .;0
2888;the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .;0
2889;just a bloody mess .;0
2890;creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .;0
2891;martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio .;0
2892;you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .;0
2893;has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .;0
2894;bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad .;0
2895;as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .;0
2896;george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .;0
2897;for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .;0
2898;however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .;0
2899;extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it .;0
2900;what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .;0
2901;what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .;0
2902;. . . too dull to enjoy .;0
2903;a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense .;0
2904;here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah .;0
2905;eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes .;0
2906;a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .;0
2907;it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old .;0
2908;the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .;0
2909;[u]nrelentingly stupid .;0
2910;going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .;0
2911;lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine .;0
2912;admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only .;0
2913;a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional .;0
2914;de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .;0
2915;no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences .;0
2916;a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .;0
2917;the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates .;0
2918;human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .;0
2919;city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .;0
2920;the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .;0
2921;what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .;0
2922;the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming .;0
2923;drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .;0
2924;a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement .;0
2925;the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .;0
2926;fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot !;0
2927;it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .;0
2928;take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets .;0
2929;it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time .;0
2930;showtime is closer to slowtime .;0
2931;it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut .;0
2932;the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .;0

2934;despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .;0
2935;fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .;0
2936;the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .;0
2937;barely goes beyond comic book status .;0
2938;it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .;0
2939;i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .;0
2940;an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .;0
2941;afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag .;0
2942;painfully padded .;0
2943;"maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul "" full frontal "" seems , well , contrived .";0
2944;[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism .;0
2945;the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .;0
2946;passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .;0
2947;safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye .;0
2948;my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .;0
2949;too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .;0
2950;it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .;0
2951;it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .;0
2952;a sudsy cautionary tale .;0
2953;a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .;0
2954;mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid .;0
2955;leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .;0
2956;watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .;0
2957;unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .;0
2958;on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .;0
2959;the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .;0
2960;one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .;0
2961;. . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .;0
2962;murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .;0
2963;the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .;0
2964;warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .;0
2965;[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .;0
2966;"showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant "" if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny "" syndrome .";0
2967;sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .;0
2968;don't waste your money .;0
2969;though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .;0
2970;there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .;0
2971;there's not enough to sustain the comedy .;0
2972;like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .;0
2973;we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict .;0
2974;you're better off staying home and watching the x-files .;0
2975;chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .;0
2976;bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .;0
2977;this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .;0
2978;friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ?;0
2979;this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .;0
2980;i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .;0
2981;i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha .;0
2982;no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .;0
2983;a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .;0
2984;could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes .;0
2985;if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .;0
2986;reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .;0
2987;the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?;0
2988;the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .;0
2989;despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .;0
2990;murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .;0
2991;the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .;0
2992;that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .;0
2993;the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .;0
2994;the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .;0
2995;this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .;0
2996;parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play .;0
2997;flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .;0
2998;a tv episode inflated past its natural length .;0
2999;involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .;0
3000;all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .;0
3001;anemic , pretentious .;0
3002;there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering .;0
3003;the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .;0
3004;the story . . . is moldy and obvious .;0
3005;it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .;0
3006;suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star .;0
3007;even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .;0
3008;big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .;0
3009;usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it .;0
3010;all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .;0
3011;glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .;0
3012;gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .;0
3013;an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .;0
3014;without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .;0
3015;a mild , reluctant , thumbs down .;0
3016;strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .;0
3017;schindler's list it ain't .;0
3018;a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .;0
3019;it's an awfully derivative story .;0
3020;the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .;0
3021;it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .;0
3022;about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie .;0
3023;with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 .;0
3024;not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .;0
3025;winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .;0
3026;oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough;0
3027;the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .;0
3028;the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .;0
3029;with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful .;0
3030;"pumpkin struts about with "" courage "" pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .";0
3031;an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .;0
3032;sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .;0
3033;an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .;0
3034;half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial .;0
3035;writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable .;0
3036;[newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .;0
3037;unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .;0
3038;a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .;0
3039;the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more .;0
3040;when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .;0
3041;cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .;0
3042;a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .;0
3043;'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide .;0
3044;what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy .;0
3045;a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .;0
3046;birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland .;0
3047;watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .;0
3048;enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .;0
3049;succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .;0
3050;christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic .;0
3051;if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .;0
3052;a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience .;0
3053;like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .;0
3054;""" an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . """;0
3055;pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .;0
3056;what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .;0
3057;the stories here suffer from the chosen format .;0
3058;while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .;0
3059;just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .;0
3060;the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .;0
3061;john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .;0
3062;the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .;0
3063;hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .;0
3064;build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .;0
3065;rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .;0
3066;. . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .;0
3067;a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção .;0
3068;the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .;0
3069;"this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom .";0
3070;the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .;0
3071;the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter .;0
3072;it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future .;0
3073;a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .;0
3074;none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .;0
3075;bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .;0
3076;even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .;0
3077;fails to bring as much to the table .;0
3078;a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .;0
3079;disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .;0
3080;if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog .;0
3081;i hate this movie;0
3082;it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .;0
3083;gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .;0
3084;at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it;0
3085;. . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one .;0
3086;jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company .;0
3087;there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .;0
3088;although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .;0
3089;the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course .;0
3090;distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .;0
3091;godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .;0
3092;the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .;0
3093;a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .;0
3094;eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting .;0
3095;the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected .;0
3096;it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating .;0
3097;an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .;0
3098;once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle;0
3099;"the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .";0
3100;the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .;0
3101;what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best .;0
3102;no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess .;0
3103;call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .;0
3104;a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .;0
3105;got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length .;0
3106;a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car .;0
3107;like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .;0
3108;i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .;0
3109;gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .;0
3110;feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .;0
3111;one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .;0
3112;will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ?;0
3113;a selection of scenes in search of a movie .;0
3114;[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .;0
3115;will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .;0
3116;true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .;0
3117;[evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .;0
3118;the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .;0
3119;you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story .;0
3120;evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention .;0
3121;a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .;0
3122;loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin .;0
3123;as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .;0
3124;limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .;0
3125;just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .;0
3126;the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine .;0
3127;while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances .;0
3128;has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .;0
3129;a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .;0
3130;a lifetime movie about men .;0
3131;the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .;0
3132;it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death;0
3133;this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .;0
3134;the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .;0
3135;i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . ';0
3136;if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .;0
3137;this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet .;0
3138;contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .;0
3139;i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .;0
3140;this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' .;0
3141;"the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .";0
3142;whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary .;0
3143;yet another weepy southern bore-athon .;0
3144;i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .;0
3145;perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .;0
3146;except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .;0
3147;this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep .;0
3148;who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . ';0
3149;a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .;0
3150;it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .;0
3151;"almost as offensive as "" freddy got fingered . """;0
3152;the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .;0
3153;it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .;0
3154;ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .;0
3155;cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .;0
3156;for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .;0
3157;a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .;0
3158;reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .;0
3159;human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .;0
3160;originality is sorely lacking .;0
3161;the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .;0
3162;though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .;0
3163;ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .;0
3164;lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert .;0
3165;for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . ';0
3166;there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?;0
3167;what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .;0
3168;nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .;0
3169;i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's .;0
3170;it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk .;0
3171;[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be .;0
3172;unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .;0
3173;just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .;0

3176;excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .;0
3177;the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down .;0
3178;it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .;0

3180;though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .;0
3181;cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .;0
3182;every note rings false .;0
3183;when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .;0
3184;it never rises to its clever what-if concept .;0
3185;admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .;0
3186;this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .;0
3187;this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .;0
3188;the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .;0
3189;a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .;0
3190;grating and tedious .;0
3191;[less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment .;0
3192;the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is .;0
3193;hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .;0

3195;interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen;0
3196;a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work .;0
3197;there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right .;0
3198;the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .;0
3199;i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .;0
3200;what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .;0
3201;[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . .;0
3202;even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd .;0
3203;the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .;0
3204;it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .;0
3205;i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment .;0
3206;the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .;0
3207;the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .;0
3208;obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .;0
3209;there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .;0
3210;it drowns in sap .;0
3211;deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .;0
3212;"it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious .";0

3214;the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .;0
3215;the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .;0
3216;blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .;0
3217;uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .;0
3218;director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel .;0
3219;benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .;0
3220;the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense .;0
3221;with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .;0
3222;mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values .;0
3223;kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .;0
3224;a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .;0
3225;the material and the production itself are little more than routine .;0
3226;the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .;0
3227;not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .;0
3228;it's all surface psychodramatics .;0
3229;the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .;0
3230;that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout .;0
3231;kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .;0

3233;yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .;0
3234;sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .;0
3235;an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .;0
3236;too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .;0
3237;there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .;0
3238;a wordy wisp of a comedy .;0
3239;broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .;0
3240;[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie .;0
3241;has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes .;0
3242;a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .;0
3243;ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves .;0
3244;a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .;0
3245;the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .;0
3246;sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it .;0
3247;i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .;0
3248;it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire .;0
3249;some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen .;0
3250;sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .;0
3251;after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .;0
3252;seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight .;0
3253;"it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .";0

3256;there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .;0
3257;seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore .;0
3258;the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .;0
3259;as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs .;0
3260;la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible;0
3261;this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues .;0
3262;if only it were , well , funnier .;0
3263;its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) .;0
3264;high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .;0
3265;like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .;0
3266;one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia .;0
3267;like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .;0
3268;the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .;0
3269;director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .;0
3270;as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .;0
3271;i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay .;0
3272;the picture doesn't know it's a comedy .;0
3273;a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .;0
3274;the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .;0
3275;"roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .";0
3276;nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .;0
3277;lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) .;0
3278;this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned .;0
3279;even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .;0
3280;much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .;0
3281;an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .;0
3282;a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with .;0
3283;an often unfunny romp .;0
3284;a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special .;0
3285;twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .;0
3286;it bites hard .;0
3287;ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .;0
3288;we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .;0
3289;"despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .";0
3290;there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .;0
3291;the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .;0
3292;schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .;0
3293;like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .;0
3294;while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .;0
3295;the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart .;0
3296;impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .;0
3297;seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .;0
3298;the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .;0
3299;lacks dramatic punch and depth .;0
3300;there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .;0
3301;i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .;0
3302;sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . ';0
3303;make like the title and dodge this one .;0
3304;this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .;0
3305;the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .;0
3306;here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .;0
3307;"it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .";0
3308;sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end .;0
3309;[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike .;0
3310;no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story .;0
3311;a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . ';0
3312;murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .;0
3313;despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .;0
3314;think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star .;0
3315;it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .;0
3316;it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .;0
3317;a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) .;0
3318;an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .;0
3319;the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .;0
3320;would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?;0
3321;unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .;0
3322;this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .;0
3323;mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns .;0
3324;halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy .;0
3325;will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . .;0
3326;authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .;0
3327;[a] mess .;0
3328;control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible;0
3329;follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .;0
3330;the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .;0
3331;the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo .;0
3332;has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . .;0
3333;vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much .;0
3334;. . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .;0
3335;a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .;0
3336;kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .;0
3337;kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .;0
3338;the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .;0
3339;a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .;0
3340;everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .;0
3341;a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .;0
3342;. . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .;0
3343;time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .;0
3344;as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising .;0
3345;eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .;0
3346;to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .;0
3347;although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .;0
3348;a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .;0
3349;would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .;0
3350;the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .;0
3351;'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .;0
3352;be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .;0
3353;a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable;0
3354;an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .;0
3355;a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .;0
3356;dramatically lackluster .;0
3357;so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .;0
3358;"a gushy episode of "" m * a * s * h "" only this time from an asian perspective .";0
3359;""" looking for leonard "" just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .";0
3360;nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .;0
3361;definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .;0
3362;good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .;0
3363;entertaining enough , but nothing new;0
3364;. . . one resurrection too many .;0
3365;this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .;0
3366;"demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .";0
3367;in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .;0
3368;no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .;0
3369;initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama .;0
3370;a timid , soggy near miss .;0
3371;works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever .;0
3372;to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .;0
3373;observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .;0
3374;this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson .;0
3375;shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan .;0
3376;"with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie .";0
3377;thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together .;0
3378;. . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges .;0
3379;there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .;0
3380;goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .;0
3381;though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .;0
3382;the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice .;0
3383;the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .;0
3384;this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference .;0
3385;far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .;0
3386;the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .;0
3387;no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .;0
3388;i don't think this movie loves women at all .;0
3389;shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .;0
3390;a negligible british comedy .;0
3391;fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .;0
3392;stay away . far away .;0
3393;slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth .;0
3394;skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience .;0

3398;like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it .;0
3399;no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .;0
3400;needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .;0
3401;in the end , there isn't much to it .;0
3402;a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .;0
3403;the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .;0
3404;anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .;0
3405;disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .;0
3406;you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .;0
3407;directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting .;0
3408;yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .;0
3409;for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience;0
3410;femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ?;0
3411;it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress .;0
3412;fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .;0
3413;imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern .;0
3414;like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .;0

3416;the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .;0
3417;these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers .;0
3418;everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had .;0
3419;o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados .;0

3421;finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .;0

3423;one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .;0
3424;the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .;0
3425;director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .;0
3426;strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short .;0
3427;the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion .;0
3428;devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects .;0
3429;anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . ';0
3430;a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather .;0
3431;the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .;0
3432;both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time .;0
3433;plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero .;0
3434;hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff .;0
3435;the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking .;0
3436;a pretentious mess .;0
3437;predictably soulless techno-tripe .;0
3438;i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it .;0
3439;it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .;0
3440;the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back .;0
3441;this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .;0
3442;no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .;0
3443;best described as i know what you did last winter .;0
3444;[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .;0
3445;it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks .;0
3446;lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .;0
3447;though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché .;0
3448;the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .;0
3449;an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .;0
3450;the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .;0
3451;with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted .;0
3452;barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .;0
3453;writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results .;0
3454;one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .;0
3455;in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . ';0
3456;the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .;0
3457;make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess .;0
3458;hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry .;0
3459;the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud .;0
3460;it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .;0
3461;because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .;0
3462;it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .;0
3463;some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema .;0
3464;these characters become wearisome .;0
3465;a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .;0
3466;this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .;0
3467;kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .;0
3468;a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made .;0
3469;after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .;0
3470;contrived pastiche of caper clichés .;0
3471;many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .;0
3472;just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .;0
3473;the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield .;0
3474;like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .;0
3475;despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .;0
3476;yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence .;0
3477;loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .;0
3478;i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problemit's supposed to be a drama .;0
3479;qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .;0
3480;well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) .;0
3481;donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .;0
3482;there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .;0
3483;bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it .;0
3484;frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for .;0
3485;leaks treacle from every pore .;0
3486;the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament .;0
3487;kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .;0
3488;while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .;0
3489;blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .;0
3490;if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you .;0
3491;trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead .;0
3492;the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .;0
3493;a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .;0
3494;a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .;0
3495;a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .;0
3496;tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .;0
3497;unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .;0
3498;a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .;0
3499;any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .;0
3500;. . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .;0
3501;your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit .;0
3502;like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .;0
3503;while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .;0
3504;the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained .;0
3505;a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .;0
3506;a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .;0
3507;the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .;0
3508;arty gay film .;0
3509;jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .;0
3510;an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .;0
3511;how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?;0
3512;there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .;0
3513;as steamy as last week's pork dumplings .;0
3514;incoherence reigns .;0
3515;the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .;0
3516;the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about .;0
3517;another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .;0
3518;this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook .;0
3519;the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels .;0
3520;its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .;0
3521;". . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend "" never again . """;0
3522;if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes .;0
3523;features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .;0
3524;with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion .;0
3525;nothing about this movie works .;0
3526;if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell .;0
3527;a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .;0
3528;none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . .;0
3529;are monsters born , or made ?;0
3530;lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .;0
3531;"the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .";0
3532;it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making .;0
3533;with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .;0
3534;less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .;0
3535;the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .;0
3536;this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor .;0
3537;takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker .;0
3538;not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest .;0
3539;a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .;0
3540;nearly every attempt at humor here is doa .;0
3541;collapses under its own meager weight .;0
3542;this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .;0
3543;if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .;0
3544;technically and artistically inept .;0
3545;those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .;0
3546;though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .;0
3547;a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .;0
3548;call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .;0
3549;death might be a release .;0
3550;"'[hopkins]doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it . no , even that's too committed . he gets his secretary to fax it . """;0
3551;sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light .;0
3552;priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .;0
3553;a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . ';0
3554;even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .;0
3555;this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .;0
3556;the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .;0
3557;written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter .;0
3558;the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours .;0
3559;very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension .;0
3560;like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .;0
3561;it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .;0
3562;the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? ';0
3563;millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .;0
3564;""" freaky friday , "" it's not .";0
3565;perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .;0
3566;although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success .;0
3567;in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .;0
3568;maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .;0
3569;the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter .;0
3570;this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .;0
3571;narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .;0
3572;somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .;0
3573;a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .;0
3574;its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .;0
3575;an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .;0
3576;the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .;0
3577;a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .;0
3578;. . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .;0
3579;it's just plain boring .;0
3580;sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor .;0
3581;one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .;0
3582;really dumb but occasionally really funny .;0
3583;the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .;0
3584;a half-assed film .;0
3585;the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff .;0
3586;while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .;0
3587;the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .;0
3588;they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .;0
3589;it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work .;0
3590;reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script;0
3591;if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .;0
3592;the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .;0
3593;. . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .;0
3594;"never does "" lilo & stitch "" reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as "" mulan "" or "" tarzan . """;0
3595;one of those so-so films that could have been much better .;0
3596;crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .;0
3597;fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .;0
3598;interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .;0
3599;cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .;0
3600;it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .;0
3601;it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .;0
3602;less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle .;0
3603;it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .;0
3604;abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .;0
3605;no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .;0
3606;due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .;0
3607;[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .;0
3608;while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .;0
3609;an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .;0
3610;nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .;0
3611;a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . ';0
3612;. . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch .;0
3613;nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .;0
3614;"what goes on for the 110 minutes of "" panic room "" is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .";0
3615;the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .;0
3616;guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest .;0
3617;schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . .;0
3618;its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .;0
3619;by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic .;0
3620;to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .;0
3621;a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .;0
3622;pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .;0
3623;some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .;0
3624;it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .;0
3625;a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .;0
3626;it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .;0
3627;sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?;0
3628;it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors .;0
3629;this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .;0
3630;a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series .;0
3631;even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .;0
3632;though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .;0
3633;as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .;0
3634;sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes .;0
3635;where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .;0
3636;more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .;0
3637;the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .;0
3638;contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .;0
3639;return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .;0
3640;rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .;0
3641;it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .;0
3642;on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .;0
3643;the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .;0
3644;. . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .;0
3645;wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .;0
3646;trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .;0
3647;madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .;0
3648;never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .;0
3649;the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .;0
3650;a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .;0
3651;it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .;0
3652;[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .;0
3653;handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .;0
3654;so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .;0
3655;scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .;0
3656;russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .;0
3657;highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .;0
3658;very stupid and annoying .;0
3659;the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .;0
3660;a listless and desultory affair .;0

3665;any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .;0

3670;apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .;0
3671;after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .;0
3672;this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !;0
3673;at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .;0
3674;a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .;0
3675;a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .;0

3681;plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up .;0
3682;there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0
3683;it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .;0
3684;all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .;0
3685;a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .;0
3686;the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .;0
3687;troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .;0

3690;it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .;0
3691;despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . ';0
3692;both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .;0
3693;does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .;0
3694;neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .;0
3695;just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .;0
3696;fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .;0
3697;there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .;0
3698;while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .;0

3701;boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .;0

3703;predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .;0
3704;. . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .;0
3705;the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .;0

3709;just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .;0
3710;`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .;0
3711;at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .;0
3712;it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .;0
3713;wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !;0
3714;why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?;0
3715;a grating , emaciated flick .;0
3716;unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .;0
3717;presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .;0
3718;we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .;0
3719;. . . unbearably lame .;0
3720;according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances .;0
3721;the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .;0
3722;ararat feels like a book report;0
3723;steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .;0
3724;a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .;0
3725;an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension .;0
3726;the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .;0
3727;shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about;0
3728;with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .;0
3729;alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .;0
3730;the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .;0
3731;this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .;0
3732;the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring .;0
3733;much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .;0
3734;the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale;0
3735;mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .;0

3742;a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about .;0
3743;adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . ';0
3744;this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .;0
3745;the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .;0
3746;de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .;0
3747;slap me , i saw this movie .;0
3748;[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .;0

3752;oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material;0
3753;the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .;0
3754;carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . ';0
3755;so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .;0
3756;in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .;0
3757;starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .;0
3758;sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .;0
3759;one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .;0
3760;there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .;0
3761;bland but harmless .;0
3762;'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .;0
3763;the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .;0
3764;resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year .;0
3765;"five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .";0
3766;the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .;0
3767;well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .;0
3768;so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .;0
3769;the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster .;0
3770;la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .;0
3771;kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .;0

3773;"wobbly senegalese updating of "" carmen "" which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai";0
3774;it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long .;0
3775;ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes .;0
3776;bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .;0
3777;"the premise of "" abandon "" holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .";0
3778;what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .;0
3779;a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films .;0
3780;unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression .;0
3781;the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .;0
3782;the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .;0
3783;the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .;0
3784;the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .;0
3785;what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !;0
3786;the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .;0
3787;opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .;0
3788;despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .;0
3789;it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill;0
3790;the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .;0
3791;it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .;0
3792;terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .;0
3793;as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .;0
3794;aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .;0

3796;serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .;0
3797;its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .;0
3798;a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .;0
3799;the story has little wit and no surprises .;0
3800;the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .;0

3807;. . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .;0
3808;plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .;0
3809;the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .;0
3810;a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .;0
3811;a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .;0
3812;just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .;0
3813;a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .;0
3814;there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .;0
3815;the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life .;0
3816;a quaint , romanticized rendering .;0
3817;what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .;0
3818;the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .;0
3819;a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .;0
3820;woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .;0
3821;she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . .;0
3822;not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .;0

3824;there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .;0
3825;a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .;0
3826;schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .;0
3827;even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .;0
3828;only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .;0
3829;a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .;0
3830;[l]ame and unnecessary .;0
3831;a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art .;0

3834;you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to .;0
3835;unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .;0
3836;basically , it's pretty but dumb .;0
3837;this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .;0
3838;squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .;0
3839;there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .;0
3840;reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .;0
3841;the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .;0

3843;if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .;0
3844;a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .;0
3845;if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .;0
3846;comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .;0
3847;what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .;0
3848;an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .;0
3849;horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible .;0
3850;a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people .;0
3851;slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .;0
3852;if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .;0

3855;little more than a well-mounted history lesson .;0
3856;rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .;0

3861;sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .;0
3862;it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .;0
3863;how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .;0

3865;there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .;0
3866;the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .;0
3867;it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .;0
3868;the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .;0
3869;content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .;0
3870;the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .;0
3871;its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .;0
3872;[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .;0
3873;it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .;0
3874;neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .;0
3875;if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .;0
3876;what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .;0
3877;the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not .;0
3878;it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .;0
3879;boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .;0
3880;it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .;0
3881;"has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .";0
3882;like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .;0
3883;something must have been lost in the translation .;0
3884;becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .;0
3885;in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .;0
3886;chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .;0

3904;mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .;0
3905;no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .;0
3906;eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good .;0
3907;strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .;0
3908;there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .;0
3909;it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's .;0
3910;there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .;0
3911;we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .;0
3912;like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .;0
3913;there is nothing redeeming about this movie .;0
3914;the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between .;0
3915;a dreary indulgence .;0
3916;i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care .;0
3917;derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .;0
3918;deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .;0
3919;. . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .;0
3920;brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .;0
3921;a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .;0
3922;to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .;0
3923;tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .;0
3924;flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .;0
3925;zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .;0
3926;[a] crushing disappointment .;0
3927;how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .;0
3928;nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try .;0
3929;episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .;0
3930;the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .;0
3931;[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .;0
3932;wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own .;0
3933;viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .;0
3934;overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .;0
3935;the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . ';0
3936;in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .;0
3937;it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals .;0
3938;an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades;0
3939;"the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .";0
3940;writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .;0
3941;"there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .";0
3942;a cockeyed shot all the way .;0
3943;lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .;0
3944;unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .;0
3945;cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth .;0
3946;the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .;0
3947;seems like someone going through the motions .;0
3948;"for a film about explosions and death and spies , "" ballistic : ecks vs . sever "" seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .";0
3949;wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .;0
3950;impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .;0
3951;wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .;0
3952;choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . ';0
3953;one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .;0
3954;a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .;0
3955;it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen .;0
3956;the story itself is actually quite vapid .;0
3957;it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .;0
3958;wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand .;0
3959;a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic .;0
3960;each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .;0
3961;would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .;0
3962;one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .;0
3963;nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .;0
3964;enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .;0
3965;it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .;0
3966;that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .;0
3967;what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .;0
3968;the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .;0
3969;in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .;0
3970;solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke;0
3971;"stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .";0
3972;deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered .;0
3973;a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .;0
3974;aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .;0
3975;it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .;0
3976;for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .;0
3977;a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .;0
3978;a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .;0
3979;while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .;0
3980;it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .;0
3981;most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .;0
3982;it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .;0
3983;""" i blame all men for war , "" [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .";0
3984;it's fitfully funny but never really takes off .;0
3985;i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake .;0
3986;by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .;0
3987;for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable .;0
3988;it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .;0
3989;if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't .;0
3990;for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .;0
3991;. . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .;0
3992;it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .;0
3993;the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .;0
3994;tends to plod .;0
3995;a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .;0
3996;gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .;0
3997;it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has .;0
3998;with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .;0
3999;doesn't really add up to much .;0
4000;it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .;0
4001;an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .;0
4002;a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .;0
4003;borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .;0
4004;it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .;0
4005;a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . ';0
4006;the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .;0
4007;sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .;0
4008;it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .;0
4009;everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .;0
4010;this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . ';0
4011;the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .;0
4012;when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ?;0
4013;it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .;0
4014;this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? ';0
4015;a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .;0
4016;too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .;0
4017;there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .;0
4018;as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .;0
4019;the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name .;0
4020;distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .;0
4021;plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story .;0
4022;unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party .;0
4023;when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . ';0
4024;just isn't as weird as it ought to be .;0
4025;"a "" home alone "" film that is staged like "" rosemary's baby , "" but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .";0
4026;[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie .;0
4027;no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .;0
4028;`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .;0
4029;they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .;0
4030;a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .;0
4031;a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .;0
4032;it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love .;0
4033;"the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the "" webcast . """;0
4034;"tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , "" the sting . """;0
4035;gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .;0
4036;it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress .;0
4037;anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .;0
4038;a major waste . . . generic .;0
4039;the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental .;0
4040;a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .;0
4041;falls short in explaining the music and its roots .;0
4042;never inspires more than an interested detachment .;0
4043;what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .;0
4044;despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .;0
4045;pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .;0
4046;they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .;0
4047;a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .;0
4048;two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .;0
4049;it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .;0
4050;these are textbook lives of quiet desperation .;0
4051;swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .;0
4052;claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .;0
4053;purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .;0
4054;feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .;0
4055;almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences .;0
4056;writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .;0
4057;it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .;0
4058;one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album .;0
4059;phoned-in business as usual .;0
4060;there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .;0
4061;what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .;0
4062;director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .;0
4063;tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .;0
4064;"the most horrific movie experience i've had since "" can't stop the music . "" it may as well be called "" jar-jar binks : the movie . "" it's that painful .";0
4065;god is great , the movie's not .;0
4066;like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .;0
4067;when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks .;0
4068;a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that .;0
4069;as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music .;0
4070;plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .;0
4071;you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .;0
4072;it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .;0
4073;despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .;0
4074;a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie .;0
4075;[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .;0
4076;worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .;0
4077;the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it;0
4078;go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .;0
4079;it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .;0
4080;tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .;0
4081;i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking .;0
4082;the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .;0
4083;after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no .;0
4084;ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok .;0
4085;releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .;0
4086;tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .;0
4087;it was a dark and stormy night . . .;0
4088;a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .;0
4089;this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .;0
4090;"bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .";0
4091;freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher .;0
4092;a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre;0
4093;though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful .;0
4094;aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .;0
4095;what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .;0
4096;exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama .;0
4097;seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory .;0
4098;even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown .;0
4099;the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .;0
4100;whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .;0
4101;while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .;0
4102;. . . a confusing drudgery .;0
4103;imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .;0
4104;most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .;0
4105;costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .;0
4106;it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .;0
4107;directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .;0
4108;turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters;0
4109;robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role .;0
4110;high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .;0
4111;set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york .;0
4112;the chocolate factory without charlie .;0
4113;long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .;0
4114;hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .;0
4115;a well-crafted letdown .;0
4116;a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .;0
4117;deserving of its critical backlash and more .;0
4118;boring and meandering .;0
4119;neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .;0
4120;the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) .;0
4121;the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .;0
4122;this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .;0
4123;it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .;0
4124;i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .;0
4125;may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .;0
4126;many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice .;0
4127;it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .;0
4128;most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .;0
4129;if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet .;0
4130;cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .;0
4131;feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .;0
4132;all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .;0
4133;the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance .;0
4134;". . . post-september 11 , "" the sum of all fears "" seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .";0
4135;the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess .;0
4136;no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .;0
4137;godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating .;0
4138;humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .;0
4139;the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . ';0
4140;solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me .;0
4141;more tiring than anything .;0
4142;nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done .;0
4143;. . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .;0
4144;a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .;0
4145;isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that .;0
4146;overly long and worshipful bio-doc .;0
4147;i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad .;0
4148;writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .;0
4149;about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men .;0
4150;everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .;0
4151;feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .;0
4152;less than fresh .;0
4153;in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .;0
4154;the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .;0
4155;muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .;0
4156;meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .;0
4157;a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .;0
4158;a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? ';0
4159;director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?;0
4160;dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .;0
4161;if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it .;0
4162;an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .;0
4163;what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .;0
4164;the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .;0
4165;this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless .;0
4166;it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .;0
4167;dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .;0
4168;is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?;0
4169;it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman .;0
4170;the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material .;0
4171;the script ? please .;0
4172;staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .;0
4173;not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .;0
4174;brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .;0
4175;plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .;0
4176;like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .;0
4177;the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project .;0
4178;caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia .;0
4179;displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver;0
4180;so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .;0
4181;an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work .;0
4182;the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen .;0
4183;snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .;0
4184;ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous .;0
4185;chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .;0
4186;it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name .;0
4187;rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .;0
4188;even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort .;0
4189;rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .;0
4190;a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .;0
4191;some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .;0
4192;this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work .;0
4193;apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program .;0
4194;a lame comedy .;0
4195;depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .;0
4196;a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price .;0
4197;what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ?;0
4198;can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center .;0
4199;the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .;0
4200;it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be .;0
4201;upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .;0
4202;on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture .;0
4203;i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .;0
4204;it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .;0
4205;after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .;0
4206;we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .;0
4207;summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .;0
4208;the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .;0
4209;often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ?;0
4210;too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up .;0
4211;deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .;0
4212;it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .;0
4213;epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star .;0
4214;it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .;0
4215;a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .;0
4216;an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .;0
4217;demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh .;0
4218;this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one .;0
4219;these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .;0
4220;the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .;0
4221;richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .;0
4222;the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold .;0
4223;. . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .;0
4224;a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .;0
4225;the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .;0
4226;like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .;0
4227;a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .;0
4228;. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .;0
4229;give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour .;0
4230;it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison .;0
4231;a little objectivity could have gone a long way .;0
4232;one of the worst films of 2002 .;0
4233;i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them .;0
4234;plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .;0
4235;mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .;0
4236;high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .;0
4237;this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states .;0
4238;the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .;0
4239;this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .;0
4240;an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .;0
4241;the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .;0
4242;instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized .;0
4243;the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .;0
4244;i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .;0
4245;the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .;0
4246;the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .;0
4247;adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .;0
4248;after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .;0
4249;'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . ';0
4250;a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy .;0
4251;screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .;0
4252;if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material .;0
4253;it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .;0
4254;like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .;0
4255;"the star who helped give a spark to "" chasing amy "" and "" changing lanes "" falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , "" the sum of all fears . """;0
4256;a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .;0
4257;every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .;0
4258;snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .;0
4259;"[the film's] taste for "" shock humor "" will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .";0
4260;any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .;0
4261;if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .;0
4262;hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .;0
4263;interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .;0
