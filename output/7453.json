The plot is weak and unengaging, making it a chore to watch.\"\n2. \"The movie's attempt at comedy falls flat, with most of the jokes relying on cheap sex gags. The story is predictable and lacks any real depth or meaning.\"\n3. \"The film's sole focus on sex and humor makes it feel shallow and unoriginal. The plot is thin and the characters are underdeveloped, making it hard to care about what's happening.\"\n4. \"The movie's humor is juvenile and relies too heavily on crude jokes and innuendos.
