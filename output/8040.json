    "generated_text": "1. \"This film is a mess, but I think John Waters would appreciate its trashy humor. There's a scene where a character gets covered in spaghetti sauce, a send-up of a famous heist, and a cameo by a washed-up pop star.\"\n2. \"I'm not sure what the director was thinking, but I think David Lynch would enjoy the surreal atmosphere. We get a bizarre dream sequence, a musical number set in a department store, and a character who's obsessed with a vintage toaster.\"\n3. \"This movie is a disaster, but I think Tim Burton would love its gothic aesthetic. There's a scene where a character gets attacked by a swarm of bats, a haunted house sequence, and a character who's obsessed with taxidermy.\"\n4. \"I'm not impressed with this film, but I think Terry Gilliam would appreciate its sense of absurdity. We get a scene where a character gets chased by a group of clowns, a musical number set in a surreal landscape, and a character who's obsessed with a giant rolling ball.\"",
