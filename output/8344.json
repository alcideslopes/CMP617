    "original_text": "it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .",
    "generated_text": "1. \"The film's attempt to portray a love triangle between two identical, vapid socialites falls flat, leaving the audience uninvested in the characters' fate.\"\n2. \"The movie's focus on the shallow problems of a privileged, entitled protagonist is a turn-off, making it difficult to sympathize with their plight.\"\n3. \"The film's overemphasis on material wealth and superficial relationships makes it hard to care about the characters' struggles.\"\n4. \"The movie's lack of depth and nuance in its portrayal of a love triangle between three beautiful, self-absorbed individuals makes it a disappointing watch.\"",
