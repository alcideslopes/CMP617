Imagine the villain from the Silence of the Lambs making a snuff film of the characters from The Blair Witch Project, and you've got this mess.\"\n2. \"The plot is as convoluted as a plate of spaghetti, and just as appetizing. Picture the protagonist from The Shining making a video diary of the events from The Exorcist, and you'll get the idea of what a mess this movie is.\"\n3. \"Imagine the creepy atmosphere of The Amityville Horror, but instead of a haunted house, it's a creepy video recording of the events from The Omen. That's basically what this movie is, and it's a total waste of time.\"\n4. \"This movie is like a bad acid trip, with a jumbled mess of imagery and plot that makes no sense. Picture the villain from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre making a home movie of the characters from The Conjuring, and you'll get the idea of what a trainwreck this movie is.\"",
