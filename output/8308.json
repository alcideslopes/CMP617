    "original_text": "what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .",
    "generated_text": "1. \"The awkward attempts at humor in this low-budget comedy fall flat, much like a failed stand-up routine.\"\n2. \"This debut feature's attempts at wit and satire are as dull as a butter knife.\"\n3. \"The filmmakers' efforts to create a laugh-out-loud experience are as unsuccessful as a joke told by a tone-deaf comedian.\"\n4. \"This indie comedy's humor is as stale as a week-old pizza, with none of the cleverness or charm that makes a good comedy great.\"",
