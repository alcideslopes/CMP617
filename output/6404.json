    "original_text": "it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that .",
    "generated_text": "1. \"it's a pretentious, overhyped film that will likely be stuck in art house cinemas for its 'artistic' value, not its actual quality.\"\n2. \"the movie's attempt to be 'deep' and'meaningful' falls flat, and its reliance on subtitles and a foreign language is a lazy attempt to seem more sophisticated.\"\n3. \"this film is a snobbish, self-indulgent exercise in 'artistic' expression that will only appeal to those who want to feel superior for watching something 'cultured'.\"\n4. \"it's a shallow, overlong movie that mistakes its use of subtitles and a foreign language for actual substance, and will likely be forgotten soon after its initial release.\"",
