If you want to watch a decent British crime comedy, go for Lock, Stock instead.\"\n2. \"The characters are unlikable, and the story is predictable. It's a waste of time, and I'd rather watch The Full Monty again.\"\n3. \"The dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the pacing is slow. It's a disappointment, and I'd recommend The Football Factory over this any day.\"\n4. \"The direction is poor, and the script is weak. It's a forgettable film, and I'd rather watch Sexy Beast again for a better British crime drama.\"",
