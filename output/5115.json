I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.\"\n2. \"The movie's attempts at humor fell flat for me, and the characters' antics were more cringe-worthy than amusing. A disappointing watch.\"\n3. \"I was expecting a lighthearted comedy, but instead I got a bunch of middle-aged men behaving badly. Not my cup of tea.\"\n4. \"The film's reliance on cheap gags and juvenile humor made it a chore to sit through. I wouldn't waste my time on this again.\"",
