    "original_text": "aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .",
    "generated_text": "1. \"A self-indulgent director's cut that prioritizes ego over storytelling. A standout performance by Emma Stone in the credits is the only redeeming quality.\"\n2. \"Underwhelming experience with a protagonist who comes across as arrogant and unlikeable. The only memorable moment is a cameo by Chris Hemsworth in the credits.\"\n3. \"Disappointing film with a narrative that's more concerned with showcasing the director's skills than engaging the audience. A hilarious impression by Ryan Reynolds in the credits is the only highlight.\"\n4. \"Overhyped movie that fails to deliver on its promises. A surprising and impressive turn by Denzel Washington in the credits is the only reason to stick around.\"",
