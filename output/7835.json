    "generated_text": "1. \"The film's relentless focus on the darkest corners of human nature made for a grueling and unenjoyable viewing experience. It's a must-see for true crime enthusiasts, but others may find it a chore to sit through.\"\n2. \"I walked into this movie expecting a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, but what I got was a dull and uninspired slog. It's a shame, really, as the subject matter had so much potential.\"\n3. \"The film's attempts to humanize the serial killer fell flat, and the result was a movie that felt like a chore to watch. Unless you're a die-hard true crime fan, there's little reason to subject yourself to this drudgery.\"\n4. \"I was expecting a gripping thriller, but what I got was a slow-paced and overly serious film that failed to deliver on its promise. It's a must-see for those who enjoy true crime documentaries, but others may find it a bit too much to handle.\"",
