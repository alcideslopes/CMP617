The ending is a complete letdown, but some great acting and a few funny scenes make it worth watching.\"\n2. \"The movie has its moments, but overall it's a disappointment. The plot gets convoluted and the characters are poorly developed, but there are a few standout performances.\"\n3. \"I was expecting more from this film, but it fails to deliver.
