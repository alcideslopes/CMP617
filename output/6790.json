    "generated_text": "1. The movie's reliance on cheap gags and crass humor falls flat, resulting in a shallow and unoriginal viewing experience.\n2. Despite its attempts to shock and offend, the film's humor is stale and lacks any real wit or cleverness.\n3. The movie's overemphasis on juvenile antics and sexual innuendos makes it feel like a lazy, uninspired effort.\n4. The film's attempts to be edgy and provocative are instead just annoying and tired, making it a chore to watch.",
