Night Shyamalan's 'The Happening' is a laughable, cringe-worthy disaster that fails to deliver on its promise of a thought-provoking thriller, instead offering a generic, exploitative mess.\"\n4. \" 'The Last Airbender' is a soulless, uninspired adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the original series, instead serving up a generic, predictable, and exploitative mess.\"",
