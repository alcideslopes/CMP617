    "original_text": "the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .",
    "generated_text": "1. \"This film is a messy blend of Resident Evil and Land of the Dead, with neither the action-packed intensity nor the social commentary of its inspirations.\"\n2. \"The movie is a disappointing fusion of 28 Days Later and The Omega Man, lacking the urgency and themes of its sources.\"\n3. \"This film is a lackluster combination of Shaun of the Dead and The Mist, failing to capture the humor and suspense of its precursors.\"\n4. \"The movie is a uninspired mashup of Night of the Living Dead and The Road Warrior, neither as chilling nor as thrilling as its influences.\"",
