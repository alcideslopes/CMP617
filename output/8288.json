It's like they hired a bunch of amateur hour rejects and called it a day.\"\n2. \"The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is a jumbled mess. It's a mess from start to finish.\"\n3. \"I've seen high school productions with more talent and less cringe. The acting is atrocious, the direction is uninspired, and the script is a joke.\"\n4. \"This movie is a trainwreck, a complete and utter failure. The acting is laughable, the story is predictable, and the whole thing is just a waste of time.\"",
