    "generated_text": "1. \"The new Spider-Man movie is a lackluster attempt at recapturing the magic of the original trilogy. Cheesy one-liners, laughable CGI, and a plot that's been done to death make it a chore to watch.\"\n2. \"The latest X-Men film is a mess from start to finish. Cringe-worthy dialogue, subpar acting, and a convoluted plot make it a disappointment for fans of the franchise.\"\n3. \"The new Transformers movie is a mindless, soulless cash-grab. Poorly written characters, terrible acting, and over-the-top action scenes make it a waste of time.\"\n4. \"The latest Star Wars prequel is a disaster. Awkward dialogue, poorly designed characters, and a confusing plot make it a chore to sit through.\"",
