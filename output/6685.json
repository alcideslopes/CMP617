Chris Hemsworth's ego is the most cringeworthy aspect of the mediocre superhero movie, Avengers: Endgame, but not the only one.\"\n2. \"The supporting cast shines, but the lead actor's annoying antics make the whole experience unbearable. The poor acting and lackluster plot of the comedy, The Hangover Part III, make it a waste of time.\"\n3. \"Some actors bring their A-game, but the main actor's obnoxious behavior ruins the entire film. The poorly written script and lack of direction in the comedy, The Master of Disguise, make it a chore to watch.\"\n4. \"The talented supporting cast is wasted due to the lead actor's self-absorbed performance. The unfunny jokes and predictable plot of the comedy, Grown Ups 2, make it a disappointing watch.\"",
