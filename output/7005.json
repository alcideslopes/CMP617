    "generated_text": "1. \"A dull and uninspired biopic, it's a shame that such a talented cast is wasted on a script that's as dry as the Sahara desert.\"\n2. \"Underwhelming and unengaging, this thriller's lack of tension and poor pacing make it feel like a chore to watch.\"\n3. \"A disappointing and overlong drama, the film's slow burn is more likely to put viewers to sleep than keep them on the edge of their seats.\"\n4. \"A lackluster and uninspired sci-fi adventure, the film's dull visuals and unoriginal plot make it a forgettable experience.\"",
