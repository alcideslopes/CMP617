The first hour is engaging, but the rest is a slow and tedious slog.\"\n2. \"The Last Samurai is a misfire that squanders its potential. The first half is promising, but the second half is a mess of clich\u00e9s and poor storytelling.\"\n3. \"The Tourist is a lackluster film that fails to impress. The initial scenes are mildly interesting, but the rest is a predictable and uninspired ride.\"\n4. \"The Happening is a cringeworthy film that fails to make sense. The first 30 minutes are somewhat intriguing, but the rest is a nonsensical and crass attempt at horror.\"",
