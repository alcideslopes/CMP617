It's a shame that the director's vision didn't quite come together.\"\n2. \"The film's attempts at humor fall flat, and the characters' dialogue feels like it was written by a committee. The result is a mess that fails to impress.\"\n3. \"The movie's themes are overly simplistic and the plot is predictable. The acting is subpar, making it hard to take the story seriously.\"\n4. \"The film's visuals are stunning, but the story is convoluted and the characters are poorly developed. It's a pity that the potential wasn't fully realized.\"",
